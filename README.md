I faced many challenges while developing this website. The first of these challenges was how I would implement the side-scrolling; after multiple attempts, all failed, I finally came across a way to create this effect using bootstrap and its flex-based col system.
The second challenge I faced was the responsiveness of the website. I used media queries and width adjustments for the bootstrap elements and grid systems for the header and footer.
I learned a lot from this project. Firstly I realized how versatile bootstrap could be at creating complex systems. Secondly, I discovered how helpful background images could be, and I regret not using them until now.
For this project, I used the bootstrap framework. I also used the adobe xd default library for my icons.
